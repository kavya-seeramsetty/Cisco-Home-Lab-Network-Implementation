<h1>Cisco Home Lab Network Implementation</h1>
<h2>Description</h2> This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a virtual enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The setup includes the creation of multiple VLANs for departmental segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and security measures. 
The network also integrates a Wireless Access Point(WAP) to enable wireless connectivity. 
The WAP is configured with WPA2-PSK encryption using a PSK passphrase and AES encryption for secure wireless communication. 
A Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) configuration is used for VLAN communication, and DHCP is set up for automatic IP address assignment. 
Network resilience is ensured with failover mechanisms. 
<h2>Utilities and Tools Used</h2>
Cisco Packet Tracer: Used for simulating and visualizing network configurations, including VLANs, routers, switches, and wireless devices.
VLAN Configuration: Creating isolated virtual networks for departmental segmentation.
Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS): Implementing inter-VLAN routing via a single router interface.
DHCP Configuration: Automating IP address assignments across the network.
Wireless Access Point Configuration: Enabling wireless connectivity through an access point with WPA2-PSK and AES encryption for secure communication.
<h2>Environments Used</h2>
Cisco Packet Tracer: Platform for building and testing network simulations.
Windows 11: Operating system used for running Cisco Packet Tracer and managing the network setup.
