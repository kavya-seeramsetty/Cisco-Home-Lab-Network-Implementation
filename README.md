# Cisco-Home-Lab-Network-Implementation
Created 3 VLANs to segment the network, set up trunking for inter-VLAN communication, and implemented Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) for device communication. Configured DHCP for automatic IP assignment. The network is fully operational with seamless communication and isolation.
