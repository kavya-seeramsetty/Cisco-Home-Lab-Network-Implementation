<h1>Cisco Home Lab Network Implementation</h1>
<h2>Description</h2> This project demonstrates the design and configuration of a virtual enterprise network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The setup includes the creation of multiple VLANs for departmental segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and security measures. The network also integrates a **Wireless Access Point** (WAP) to enable wireless connectivity. The WAP is configured with **WPA2-PSK** encryption using a **PSK passphrase** and **AES encryption** for secure wireless communication. A **Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)** configuration is used for VLAN communication, and **DHCP** is set up for automatic IP address assignment. Network resilience is ensured with failover mechanisms. <h2>Utilities and Tools Used</h2>
Cisco Packet Tracer: Used for simulating and visualizing network configurations, including VLANs, routers, switches, and wireless devices.
VLAN Configuration: Creating isolated virtual networks for departmental segmentation.
Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS): Implementing inter-VLAN routing via a single router interface.
DHCP Configuration: Automating IP address assignments across the network.
Wireless Access Point Configuration: Enabling wireless connectivity through an access point with WPA2-PSK and AES encryption for secure communication.
<h2>Environments Used</h2>
Cisco Packet Tracer: Platform for building and testing network simulations.
Windows 11: Operating system used for running Cisco Packet Tracer and managing the network setup.
